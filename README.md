# Git committer
### Little command line tool written in Golang, to make git commitment easier. 

Performs a "git add ." followed by a "git commit -m".

It works with these three values:
1. Title of the commit
2. What are you changing with this commit
3. Why are you changing this

* Those will be naturally asked when running the program via standard input.
* There's already a binary included, but you can also run it by yourself if you have the neccesary Golang tools installed.

_________________
### Command line arguments support will be added in the future.
Current funcionality for it is poorly implemented.

The "git commit" command for this project was perfomed using this tool.
